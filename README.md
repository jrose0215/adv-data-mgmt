# üìä DVD Rental Summary Report (WGU Pre-Assessment Project)

This project analyzes rental data from the Showtime DVD database to identify the most frequently rented films. It includes detailed and summary reporting using SQL, along with automation features like user-defined functions, triggers, and a stored procedure.

This was completed as part of the **Advanced Data Management** course at WGU.
